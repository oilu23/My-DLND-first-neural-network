# My-DLND-first-neural-network

Introduction
In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.

Instructions
Download the project materials from our GitHub repository. You can either download the repository with git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git, or download it as an archive file from this link. Our files in the GitHub repo are the most up to date, so it's the best place to get the project files.
cd into the **first-neural-network directory**.
Download anaconda or miniconda based on the instructions in the Anaconda lesson.
Create a new conda environment:

    conda create --name dlnd python=3

Enter your new environment:

    Mac/Linux: >> source activate dlnd
    Windows: >> activate dlnd
  
Ensure you have **numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook** installed by doing the following:
    
    conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook

Run the following to open up the notebook:

    jupyter notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb

Follow the instructions in the notebook will lead you through the project.
Ensure you've passed the unit tests in the notebook before you submit the project!
If you need help running the notebook file, check out the Jupyter notebook lesson.
